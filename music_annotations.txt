# Annotations for music pieces:

# The value 1 is not used, so that annotations with no value are
# equivalent to annotations with value 1. This is intended to
# represent some middle/standard/default value.

s    start (between pieces, before the beginning)
e    end (0 = could be an end if needed)
i    inspired (0 = somewhat, 2 = nicely)
u    uninspired (0 = a little, 2 = very much)
g    glitch (0 = small, 2 = major)
