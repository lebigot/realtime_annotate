Real-time annotation tool.

Annotations are timestamped. They contain user-defined values.

Optionally, some real-time player (music player, video player, MIDI
player,...) can be controlled so that annotation timestamps are
synchronized with the player (the player time head is automatically
set to the annotation timestamp; the player is started and stopped at
the same times as the annotation process).
